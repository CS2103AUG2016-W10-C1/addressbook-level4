## Appendix B : Use Cases

(For all use cases below, the **System** is the `TaskMan` and the **Actor** is the `user`, unless specified otherwise)

#### Use case 1: Delete task

**MSS**

1. User requests to list tasks
2. TaskMan shows a list of tasks
3. User requests to delete a specific task in the list
4. User confirms his request to delete the specific task in the list
5. TaskMan deletes the task <br>
Use case ends.

**Extensions**

2a. The list is empty

> Use case ends

3a. The given index is invalid

> 3a1. TaskMan shows an error message <br>
  Use case resumes at step 2

4a. User cancels his confirmation

> Use case resumes at step 2

5. Data file(s) should be in human-readable format.
6. Storage files are locked from external writing when the application is running.
7. UI should be eye-friendly.
8. Users should be visually informed when the application hangs.

### 2. [TaskWarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/)
#### Strengths
1. CLI GTD tool
2. No GUI but data is rendered clearly on CLI
3. Flexibility in commands (can adapt to changes in some of the command sequences, and lots of optional option flags available)
4. Data stored as human-readable text files
5. Data may be exported or imported in JSON format
6. Able to synchronise across devices via cloud storage

#### Limitations
7. Inconvenient to set up in Windows
8. All commands must be prepended with "task" because TaskWarrior does not create a CLI environment for itself
9. Commands always require Shift + Key (e.g. colons, plus signs and underscores) which slow down typing especially for keyboards without number pads
